# Running the published executable

Unzip the published.zip onto your local machine. Excecute ~TaskGrab.exe~

# Running the source code

Open the TaskGrab project using VIsual Studio 2019. In order to run the source we need to set up the database. 
Once in Visual Studio open the **Package Manager Console** (Tools **>** NuGet Package Manager **>** Package Manager Console)

Execute the following commands within the package manager console:
<pre>
PM> <b>Script-Migration</b>
PM> <b>Update-Database</b>
</pre>


# A note on first startup

When you run the application for the same time it will show the map with no markers on it, this is because the application pupulates the database with a list of auto generated tasks, as well as getting latitude and longitude locations for each of the locations of the tasks.

**This takes some time** Around 2-4 minutes. After the database is poupulated the application should boot up quicker on next executions.
