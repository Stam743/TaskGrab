# Setting up database:

To set up the database download the repo on your local machine, and open it using Visual Studio.
Once in Visual Studio open the **Package Manager Console** (Tools **>** NuGet Package Manager **>** Package Manager Console)

Execute the following commands within the package manager console:
<pre>
PM> <b>Script-Migration</b>
PM> <b>Update-Database</b>
</pre>

The databse will be populated when you run the program for the first time, this will take some time. 
Note: There will be a number of exceptions thrown while the database is populated, fear not! this is normal.

## Implementing tour for every page

A tour of the contents of each page must be generated. The tour should cover the general options available to the user at the current page

# Utilities

The project contains two utitilities thus far, `History` and `QueryString`

## History

The history utility allows easy navigation.

### `history.GoTo(string path)`

 Go to the specified page. Path is relative to the project root, example: 

`history.GoTo("Pages/TaskView/Grabber.xaml")`

Parameters can be passed by way of url encoding, ex:

`history.GoTo("Pages/TaskView/Grabber.xaml?id=2&view=chat")`

### `history.Replace(string path)`

Works like `history.GoTo` except that the given path replaces the current path in the history.

## QueryString

Allows parsing of url parameters

Getting specific parameter:

```
string id;
bool success = query_string.TryGetValue("id", out id);
```

# Skeletons

Each page has already been created and populated with helper fields:

- `MainWindow main` > Access the main window 
- `History history` > Access the history object
- `QueryString query_string` > Access the query parameters passed to the page

# Access Task Data

To acces the tasks database use the following:

```
TaskGrabContext task_grab_context = new TaskGrabContext();
DbSet<Data.Task> tasks = task_grab_context.Tasks;
```

Task data is defined in `Data/Task.cs`

To add content to database:

```
 task_grab_context.Tasks.Add(task);
 task_grab_context.SaveChanges();
```
